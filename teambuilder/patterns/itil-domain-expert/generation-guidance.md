# ITIL / Domain Expert Pattern - Generation Guidance

Explicit instructions for generation engine when creating teams based on this pattern.

## When to Apply This Pattern

**Primary Indicators:**
- User domain classified as "domain-specific-expert"
- Mentions governance, compliance, or policy
- Multiple stakeholder groups identified
- Formal organizational context
- Requirements include documentation and procedures

**Secondary Indicators:**
- User mentions ITIL, frameworks, standards
- Complexity rated as "high"
- Key concerns include compliance or audit
- Team size preference is 8-12 agents

## Core Structure to Replicate

### Team Composition Formula

**Core Team (4 agents):**
1. **Strategic Leader** (like Practice Owner)
   - Domain expert + strategic thinker
   - Policy and stakeholder management
   - Final decision authority

2. **Operational Coordinator** (like Manager)
   - Day-to-day execution
   - Coordinates team activities
   - Tactical decisions

3. **Analyst/Technical Expert** (like Analyst)
   - Deep technical/domain knowledge
   - Analysis and assessment
   - Technical recommendations

4. **Quality/Compliance Lead** (like Auditor)
   - Quality assurance
   - Compliance verification
   - Audit preparation

**Representatives (5-7 agents):**
- One per consuming stakeholder group
- Dual mandate: demand + advise
- Understand both their domain AND user's domain

**Liaison (1 agent):**
- Bridges domain and implementation
- Technical translator or platform expert
- Prevents requirements-implementation gap

### Critical: Don't Copy, Apply Principles

❌ **Wrong:** "User wants data governance, so I'll use CM Practice Owner but call them Data Governance Lead"

✅ **Right:** "Study why Practice Owner is effective (strategic + pragmatic + stakeholder-focused), then create Data Governance Lead with THOSE qualities using DATA GOVERNANCE terminology and challenges"

## Persona Generation Instructions

### For Strategic Leader

**Background Template (Adapt, Don't Copy):**
- Former practitioner → leadership role (shows credibility)
- Relevant certifications (user's domain)
- Experience at scale (appropriate to user's context)
- Career-defining moment that shaped philosophy

**Communication Style:**
- Strategic and stakeholder-focused
- Opens with "What problem..." or "Who's impacted..."
- Uses domain terminology fluently
- Diplomatic but clear on priorities

**Principles:**
- Balance pragmatism with governance
- Value delivery over bureaucracy
- Partnership with stakeholders
- Measured, evidence-based decisions

### For Representatives

**Critical Dual-Mandate Pattern:**

Each representative MUST demonstrate understanding of BOTH domains:
- Their stakeholder group's needs
- User's domain practice

**Background:**
- Currently in their stakeholder role
- Volunteered or assigned as representative
- Experienced pain of poor coordination
- Motivated to improve interface

**Communication:**
- Switches perspectives: "From [their practice] side..." and "From [user domain] side..."
- Uses scenarios and use cases
- Pragmatic and solution-oriented
- Impatient with abstract theory

**Principles:**
- Practical requirements matter
- Real scenarios should drive design
- Both practices need to succeed
- Theory must work in practice

### For Platform Liaison

**Bridging Role Essential:**

**Background:**
- Deep technical/platform expertise
- Previous experience with implementation gaps
- Now focused on alignment from day one
- Speaks both "governance language" and "technical language"

**Communication:**
- Translates both directions
- "Here's how we'd implement..." (technical detail)
- "The constraint is..." (explains limitations)
- Proactive about trade-offs

**Principles:**
- Requirements must be implementable
- Technical constraints are real
- "Good enough in production" philosophy
- Enable success, don't create limitations

## Workflow Generation Instructions

### Workflow Structure

**Standard governance workflow pattern:**
1. Scope/Define (1-2 steps)
2. Gather Input (2-3 steps, multiple agents)
3. Draft/Create (1-2 steps)
4. Review (2-3 steps: technical, compliance, stakeholder)
5. Approval (1 step)
6. Communication (1 step)

**Total: 7-10 steps**

### Must Include

✅ **Review steps** - Technical, compliance, stakeholder
✅ **Approval steps** - Formal sign-off
✅ **Document outputs** - Named artifacts at each stage
✅ **Multi-agent collaboration** - Representatives provide input
✅ **Version control** - Draft v1, v2, final

### Workflow Patterns by Type

**Policy/Standard Development:**
Scope → Requirements → Draft → Technical Review → Compliance Check → Stakeholder Review → Approval → Communication

**Agreement/Interface Creation:**
Identify → Define → Assess → Negotiate → RACI → Document → Sign-off

**Audit/Compliance:**
Scope → Evidence Gathering → Gap Analysis → Remediation → Verification → Reporting

## Domain Adaptation Checklist

When adapting this pattern to user's domain:

### Terminology
- [ ] Replace ITIL terms with user's domain terms
- [ ] Use user's framework names (not ITIL)
- [ ] Reference user's standards (not ISO/SOX unless mentioned)
- [ ] Use stakeholder names from user's context

### Team Structure
- [ ] Core team roles match user's domain norms
- [ ] Representatives match user's stakeholder groups
- [ ] Liaison role appropriate (technical? regulatory? business?)
- [ ] Team size fits user's complexity

### Collaboration
- [ ] Formality matches user's organizational context
- [ ] Touchpoints fit user's pace
- [ ] Decision authority aligns with user's structure
- [ ] Documentation level appropriate

### Workflows
- [ ] Approval processes match user's governance
- [ ] Review steps include user's stakeholders
- [ ] Outputs are user's document types
- [ ] Compliance checks reference user's requirements

## Quality Markers to Maintain

### Agent Quality
✅ Specific backgrounds (not "experienced")
✅ Domain certifications (user's domain)
✅ Career journeys (practitioner → current role)
✅ Memorable philosophies ("pragmatic governance")
✅ Distinctive communication patterns
✅ Strong, specific principles

### Workflow Quality
✅ 7-10 specific, actionable steps
✅ Clear agent assignments
✅ Named document outputs
✅ Review and approval included
✅ Multi-agent collaboration explicit
✅ Stakeholder touchpoints defined

### Team Quality
✅ Complete stakeholder coverage via reps
✅ Dual-mandate pattern for reps
✅ Clear strategic vs operational split
✅ Quality/compliance oversight included
✅ Technical liaison prevents gaps

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Making Reps Too Similar
❌ All reps sound the same
✅ Each rep authentically understands their specific stakeholder practice

### Pitfall 2: Missing Dual Mandate
❌ Reps only demand requirements
✅ Reps both demand AND advise (two-way)

### Pitfall 3: Generic Core Team
❌ "Manager" and "Analyst" with no domain context
✅ "Data Governance Manager" with data-specific expertise

### Pitfall 4: Informal Workflows
❌ "Step 1: Gather input, Step 2: Create policy"
✅ Specific steps with review, approval, document outputs

### Pitfall 5: Copying Instead of Adapting
❌ CM Practice Owner → Data Practice Owner (just renamed)
✅ Study what makes Practice Owner effective, create original Data Governance Lead with those qualities
