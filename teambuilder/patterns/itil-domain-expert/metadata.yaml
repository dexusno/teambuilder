    application: "Use when team needs to interface with multiple other domains or functions"

  - name: "Core Team + Specialists + Liaison Structure"
    description: "Core practice team (owner, manager, analyst) + specialist representatives + platform liaison"
    application: "Effective for governance teams that coordinate across multiple functions"

# Anti-Patterns to Avoid
anti_patterns:
  - pattern: "Making all representatives sound identical"
    fix: "Each representative understands their specific practice deeply"

  - pattern: "Core team too generic ('manager', 'analyst')"
    fix: "Add domain context - 'CM Manager', 'CM Analyst' with specific expertise"

  - pattern: "Workflows too informal for governance context"
    fix: "Add approval steps, compliance checks, formal documentation"

  - pattern: "Missing liaison role"
    fix: "Technical platform liaison essential for implementation"
