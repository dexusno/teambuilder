# Software Development Pattern - Collaboration Model

## Style: Agile with Sprint Ceremonies

**Daily Standup (Virtual):**
- All agents report: What done yesterday, what doing today, any blockers
- Scrum Master facilitates, removes blockers
- 15 minutes, focused

**Sprint Planning (Every 2 weeks):**
- Product Manager presents priorities
- Tech Lead + Developers estimate and plan
- Team commits to sprint goal

**Code Review:**
- Tech Lead + Peer review all code
- Focus on quality, maintainability, learning
- Asynchronous with sync discussion for complex changes

**Sprint Review:**
- Developers demo completed features
- Product Manager + stakeholders provide feedback
- Celebrate wins, discuss improvements

**Sprint Retrospective:**
- Team reflects on process
- What went well, what to improve
- Action items for next sprint

## Decision Flow

**What to Build:** Product Manager (with user data/feedback)
**How to Build:** Tech Lead guides, developers contribute, consensus preferred
**Quality Standards:** QA sets standards, Tech Lead enforces
**Sprint Scope:** Team consensus with PM final say if conflict

**Agile, iterative, collaborative - fast feedback loops and quality built-in.**
