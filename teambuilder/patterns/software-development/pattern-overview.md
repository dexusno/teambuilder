# Software Development Pattern Overview

## Pattern Purpose
Agile software development teams (6-8 agents) for building features, services, and applications using sprint-based iterative delivery.

## Problem Solved
**Challenge:** Building software requires diverse skills (product, architecture, development, testing, deployment) working in fast iterations with quality.

**This Pattern's Solution:**
- Scrum-inspired role structure
- Sprint-based workflows (planning → dev → test → review → retro)
- Technical excellence + delivery velocity
- Collaborative decision-making

## Team Composition (6-8 agents)
- **Product Manager**: What to build, priorities
- **Architect/Tech Lead**: Technical direction, system design
- **Scrum Master**: Process facilitation, blocker removal
- **Developers (1-3)**: Code implementation
- **QA Engineer**: Testing, quality assurance
- **DevOps Engineer (optional)**: CI/CD, infrastructure

## Key Innovations
1. **Velocity Focus**: Measure progress by working software delivered
2. **Sprint Ceremonies**: Planning, daily standup, review, retrospective
3. **Quality Integrated**: QA throughout, not afterthought
4. **Collaborative Architecture**: Tech Lead guides, doesn't dictate

## Example Use Cases
- Web app feature: User authentication, dashboard, API
- Mobile app development
- Microservice creation
- Internal tools

## When to Use
✅ Software/code projects
✅ Iterative development
✅ Quality important
✅ 2-4 week delivery cycles

**Agile software development with technical excellence and quality focus.**
