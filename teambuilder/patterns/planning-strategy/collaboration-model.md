# Planning / Strategy Pattern - Collaboration

## Style: Consultative Multi-Perspective

**Planning Sessions:**
- Strategy Lead facilitates
- Each perspective weighs in (vision, risk, stakeholder, financial)
- Debate and discussion encouraged
- Seek consensus, acknowledge disagreement

**Perspective Rotation:**
- Vision session: Strategy Lead leads
- Risk session: Risk Analyst leads
- Stakeholder session: Stakeholder Manager leads
- Each agent brings their lens

**Synthesis Approach:**
- Strategy Lead synthesizes perspectives
- Not "majority vote" but "integration of viewpoints"
- Acknowledge trade-offs explicitly
- Present options not single answer

**User Interaction:**
- Team presents analysis and recommendations
- User asks questions, team answers
- User makes final decision
- Team supports execution

**Decision Authority:**
- User retains all decision authority
- Team is advisory only
- Can disagree with user's choice but support execution

**Consultative, multi-perspective, user-empowering - advisory not directive.**
