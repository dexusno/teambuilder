# Planning / Strategy Pattern Overview

## Purpose
Strategic planning teams (6-8 agents) providing multi-perspective analysis and decision support for complex business decisions.

## Problem Solved
**Challenge:** Strategic decisions need vision, execution planning, risk analysis, stakeholder consideration, and financial assessment - no single person has all perspectives.

**Solution:** Consultative team where each agent brings distinct perspective. User retains authority; team provides analysis and recommendations.

## Team (6-8 agents)
- Strategy Lead: Vision, big picture, strategic direction
- Project Planner: Execution, roadmap, dependencies
- Risk Analyst: What could go wrong, mitigation
- Stakeholder Manager: Political landscape, alignment
- Financial Analyst: Business case, ROI, costs
- Implementation Lead: Feasibility, resources, timeline

## Key Innovation
**Consultative Multi-Perspective:** Not one "strategic planner" but diverse viewpoints. Team discusses, debates, synthesizes recommendations. User decides.

## Use Cases
- Business strategy development
- M&A evaluation
- Product roadmap planning
- Organizational transformation
- Market entry strategy

**Deliberate, consultative, multi-perspective strategic support.**
