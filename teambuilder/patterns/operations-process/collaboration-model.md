# Operations / Process Excellence Pattern - Collaboration

## Style: Structured Improvement Cycles

**Improvement Rhythm:**
- Champion sets direction and removes obstacles
- Analyst provides data and measurement
- Quality Specialist leads root cause analysis
- Change Facilitator engages stakeholders
- Implementation Coordinator executes changes
- Cycles through DMAIC phases systematically

**Work Pattern:**
- Phase gates ensure thorough work before moving forward
- Data validation before drawing conclusions
- Root cause verification before implementing solutions
- Pilot testing before full rollout
- Control mechanisms before declaring victory

## Communication Patterns

**Daily (during active improvement):**
- Brief standups: progress, obstacles, help needed
- Visual management boards show status

**Weekly:**
- Team meetings to review data, discuss findings
- Stakeholder updates on progress

**Phase Transitions:**
- Formal reviews at end of each DMAIC phase
- Gate decisions: proceed, iterate, or stop

**Gemba Practice:**
- Regular visits to where work happens
- Talk to frontline workers, observe actual process
- Validate assumptions with reality

## Decision Authority

| Decision Type | Primary Authority | Input From |
|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| Project scope and goals | Process Champion | All stakeholders |
| Measurement approach | Process Analyst | Quality Specialist, SME |
| Root cause determination | Quality Specialist | Analyst (data), SME (feasibility) |
| Solution selection | Process Champion | Full team consensus |
| Implementation approach | Implementation Coordinator | SME, Change Facilitator |
| Pilot go/no-go | Process Champion | Analyst (data) |
| Full rollout approval | Process Champion + Sponsor | Full team |
| Control plan design | Quality Specialist | Analyst, Implementation Coordinator |

## Quality Gates

**Define → Measure:**
- Problem clearly defined with business impact
- Scope bounded and achievable
- Team formed and committed

**Measure → Analyze:**
- Reliable baseline data collected
- Current state mapped and validated
- Measurement system verified

**Analyze → Improve:**
- Root causes identified and validated with data
- Vital few causes separated from trivial many
- Team consensus on root causes

**Improve → Control:**
- Solutions piloted successfully
- Results validated statistically
- Standard work documented

**Control → Closure:**
- Control mechanisms in place and working
- Process owner trained and accepting ownership
- Sustainability audit passed

## Conflict Resolution

**Data disagreements:** Analyst provides additional analysis; team reviews together
**Solution preferences:** Impact/effort evaluation; Champion makes final call if consensus not reached
**Root cause debates:** Quality Specialist facilitates structured analysis; data breaks ties
**Implementation obstacles:** Champion removes barriers; escalates to sponsor if needed

## Stakeholder Engagement

**Frontline workers:** Engaged from start; ideas actively solicited; participate in gemba walks
**Middle management:** Regular updates; involved in solution design; accountable for implementation
**Executive sponsors:** Milestone reviews; obstacle escalation; visible support
**Process owners:** Involved throughout; formal handoff at project close; own sustainability

**Structured phases, data-driven gates, inclusive engagement, sustainable results.**
