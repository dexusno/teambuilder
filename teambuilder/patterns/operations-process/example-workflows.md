  Step 13: Pilot Execution
    Agents: Implementation Coordinator + Subject Matter Expert
    Action: Execute pilot. Collect data. Adjust as needed.

Phase 5: CONTROL
  Step 14: Results Validation
    Agent: Process Analyst
    Action: Compare pilot results to baseline. Validate improvement is statistically significant.

  Step 15: Standard Work Documentation
    Agents: Implementation Coordinator + Subject Matter Expert
    Action: Document new process as standard work. Create training materials.

  Step 16: Control Plan
    Agent: Quality Specialist
    Action: Establish control mechanisms - control charts, audits, response plans for out-of-control conditions.

  Step 17: Full Rollout
    Agent: Implementation Coordinator
    Action: Scale solution beyond pilot. Train all affected personnel.

  Step 18: Handoff and Closure
    Agent: Process Champion
    Action: Transfer ownership to process owner. Document lessons learned. Celebrate success.

## Kaizen Event (Rapid Improvement) Workflow

```
Pre-Event (1-2 weeks before)
  Step 1: Event Charter
    Agent: Process Champion
    Action: Define event scope, goals, and success metrics. Ensure leadership support.

  Step 2: Team Selection
    Agent: Change Facilitator
    Action: Assemble cross-functional team including people who do the work daily.

  Step 3: Current State Data
    Agent: Process Analyst
    Action: Gather existing data. Prepare baseline metrics.

Event Day 1: Understand
  Step 4: Kickoff and Training
    Agent: Change Facilitator
    Action: Brief team on goals, methodology, and ground rules. Quick Lean basics training.

  Step 5: Gemba Walk
    Agents: All team members
    Action: Go to where work happens. Observe current state. Talk to workers.

  Step 6: Current State Map
    Agents: All team members (facilitated by Change Facilitator)
    Action: Create detailed current state value stream map on wall. Mark waste and pain points.

Event Day 2-3: Analyze and Improve
  Step 7: Waste Analysis
    Agents: All team members
    Action: Categorize waste identified. Prioritize by impact and ease of elimination.

  Step 8: Root Cause Deep Dive
    Agent: Quality Specialist
    Action: For top problems, conduct 5 Whys analysis. Identify true root causes.

  Step 9: Future State Design
    Agents: All team members
    Action: Design improved process. Create future state map. Identify specific changes needed.

  Step 10: Implementation Planning
    Agent: Implementation Coordinator
    Action: Create action list with owners and deadlines. Identify quick wins for immediate implementation.

Event Day 4-5: Implement
  Step 11: Quick Win Implementation
    Agents: All team members
    Action: Implement changes that can be done during event. Test and adjust.

  Step 12: Longer-term Action Planning
    Agent: Implementation Coordinator
    Action: Detail plans for changes requiring more time. Assign owners and deadlines.

  Step 13: Results Review
    Agent: Process Analyst
    Action: Measure initial results from implemented changes.

  Step 14: Report Out
    Agent: Process Champion
    Action: Present results to leadership. Celebrate team efforts. Commit to follow-up.

Post-Event (30-90 days)
  Step 15: Action Item Follow-up
    Agent: Implementation Coordinator
    Action: Track completion of remaining action items. Remove obstacles.

  Step 16: Sustainability Check
    Agent: Quality Specialist
    Action: Audit new process. Verify improvements are holding. Address any backsliding.
