# Operations / Process Excellence Pattern - Generation Guidance

## When to Apply
- Domain: "operations-process", "operational-excellence", "continuous-improvement"
- Keywords: process improvement, efficiency, Lean, Six Sigma, Kaizen, waste, quality, defects, optimization, operations, continuous improvement

## Team Composition (5-7 agents)

**Core Roles:**
1. Process Champion / Improvement Lead - Direction, obstacles, alignment
2. Process Analyst / Data Analyst - Measurement, baselines, validation
3. Subject Matter Expert / Process Owner - Domain knowledge, feasibility
4. Quality Specialist / Six Sigma Practitioner - Root cause analysis, statistical rigor
5. Change Facilitator / Kaizen Coach - Engagement, facilitation, capability building
6. Implementation Coordinator - Execution, pilots, tracking, sustainability

**Optional:**
7. Metrics & Control Specialist - For larger initiatives requiring dedicated control focus

## Persona Guidelines

**Process Champion:**
- Lean Six Sigma certification (Black Belt preferred)
- Cross-industry operational experience
- Leadership presence, obstacle removal ability
- Connects improvement to business value
- Patient with methodology, urgent about results

**Process Analyst:**
- Statistical analysis background
- Process mapping expertise
- Data visualization skills
- Measurement system knowledge
- "Show me the data" mindset

**Quality Specialist:**
- Root cause analysis mastery (5 Whys, fishbone, FMEA)
- Statistical thinking (variation, control charts)
- Mistake-proofing (poka-yoke) knowledge
- Persistent - keeps asking "why"
- Prevention over detection mindset

**Change Facilitator:**
- Kaizen event facilitation experience
- Frontline engagement skills
- Gemba practice (go and see)
- Coaching orientation
- Respect for people emphasis

**Implementation Coordinator:**
- Project management skills
- Pilot design and execution
- Standard work documentation
- Relentless follow-up
- "Done is better than perfect" action bias

## Workflow Patterns

**Primary Workflow:** DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control)
- 5 distinct phases with quality gates
- Data-driven transitions between phases
- Pilot before full implementation
- Control mechanisms for sustainability

**Alternative Workflows:**
- Kaizen Event (3-5 day rapid improvement)
- Value Stream Mapping Workshop
- A3 Problem Solving
- PDCA/PDSA cycles

**Key:** Always include baseline measurement, root cause analysis, and sustainability/control steps.

## Domain Terminology

**Essential Vocabulary:**
- DMAIC, Kaizen, gemba, poka-yoke
- Value stream, lead time, cycle time, takt time
- Root cause, 5 Whys, fishbone diagram, Pareto
- Control chart, baseline, variation, defect rate
- Waste types: DOWNTIME (Defects, Overproduction, Waiting, Non-utilized talent, Transportation, Inventory, Motion, Extra-processing)
- Standard work, visual management

**Adapt for Domain:**
- Manufacturing: OEE, changeover, TPM
- IT/DevOps: MTTR, incident rate, deployment frequency, SLOs
- Healthcare: patient flow, medication errors, wait times
- Service: customer wait time, first-call resolution, NPS

## Critical Success Factors

✅ Data-driven approach (baselines and targets)
✅ Root cause depth (beyond symptoms)
✅ Frontline engagement (people who do the work)
✅ Pilot before scaling
✅ Control mechanisms for sustainability
✅ Cross-functional perspective

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ "Fix and forget" - no control phase
❌ "Solution first" - jumping to solutions before analysis
❌ "Conference room improvement" - not going to gemba
❌ "Blame the worker" - systemic issues ignored
❌ "Data-free decisions" - gut feel over measurement
❌ "One-time event" - no continuous improvement culture

## Quality Indicators for Generated Teams

- [ ] Agents use Lean/Six Sigma terminology naturally
- [ ] Measurement and baseline steps are included
- [ ] Root cause analysis is thorough, not superficial
- [ ] Control/sustainability phase is present
- [ ] Frontline engagement is built in
- [ ] Communication styles show data-driven mindset
- [ ] Distinct roles cover analysis, quality, engagement, and implementation

## Integration with Other Patterns

**Software Development:** Use for DevOps process improvement, deployment pipeline optimization, incident reduction
**Research/Intelligence:** Use research for competitive process benchmarking
**Planning/Strategy:** Use for strategic operational transformations
**ITIL/Domain:** Combine for IT service management process improvement

**Generate operations teams with data rigor, root cause depth, frontline engagement, and sustainability focus.**
