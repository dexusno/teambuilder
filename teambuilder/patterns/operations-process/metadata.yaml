agent_structure:
  core_team:
    - "Process Champion / Improvement Lead"
    - "Process Analyst / Data Analyst"
    - "Subject Matter Expert / Process Owner"
    - "Quality Specialist / Six Sigma Practitioner"

    - "DMAIC Improvement Cycle"
    - "Value Stream Mapping Workshop"
    - "Kaizen Event / Rapid Improvement"
    - "Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys, Fishbone)"
    - "Control Chart Implementation"
  iteration: "Improvement cycles with defined phases"

quality_indicators:
  - "Lean/Six Sigma terminology (DMAIC, Kaizen, gemba)"
  - "Data-driven mindset (metrics, baselines, targets)"

  - "Waste identification (8 wastes of Lean)"

generation_guidance:
  - "Use operational excellence terminology"
  - "Include measurement and baseline steps"
  - "Root cause analysis is critical, not optional"
  - "Control/sustainability step prevents backsliding"
  - "Cross-functional perspective (not just one department)"
  - "Agents should understand waste types and value concepts"
