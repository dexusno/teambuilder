# Research / Intelligence Pattern Overview

## Purpose
Research teams (6-8 agents) for deep investigation, market research, competitive intelligence, and information synthesis.

## Problem Solved
**Challenge:** Quality research requires search expertise, source evaluation, multi-source triangulation, and synthesis ability.

**Solution:** Specialized team with query design, search execution, source evaluation, fact-checking, and synthesis roles. Iterative refinement until comprehensive answer found.

## Team (6-8 agents)
- Research Strategist: Query design, research direction
- Search Specialist(s): Execute searches across sources
- Source Evaluator: Assess credibility and quality
- Synthesis Analyst: Connect insights, identify patterns
- Fact Checker: Verify claims and accuracy
- Report Writer: Create final deliverable

## Key Innovation
**Iterative Search Refinement:** Query → Search → Evaluate quality → Refine query → Search again. Not "search once and report" but iterative deepening.

## Use Cases
- Market research (TAM, competitors, trends)
- Competitive intelligence
- Academic research
- Due diligence investigation
- Technical research

**Thorough, iterative research with source validation and synthesis.**
