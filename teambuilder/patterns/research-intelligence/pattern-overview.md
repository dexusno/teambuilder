# Research / Intelligence Pattern Overview

## Purpose
Research and analytics teams (6-8 agents) for deep investigation, market research, competitive intelligence, data analysis, and insight synthesis.

## Problem Solved
**Challenge:** Quality research and analysis require expertise in question framing, information/data gathering, source/data evaluation, multi-source triangulation, and synthesis ability.

**Solution:** Specialized team with query/hypothesis design, search/data collection, source/data evaluation, fact-checking/validation, and synthesis roles. Iterative refinement until comprehensive answer found.

## Team (6-8 agents)

**Research Focus:**
- Research Strategist: Query design, research direction
- Search Specialist(s): Execute searches across sources
- Source Evaluator: Assess credibility and quality
- Synthesis Analyst: Connect insights, identify patterns
- Fact Checker: Verify claims and accuracy
- Report Writer: Create final deliverable

**Analytics Focus:**
- Analytics Lead: Question framing, hypothesis design
- Data Gatherer(s): Data collection and preparation
- Data Quality Specialist: Validate data integrity
- Insights Analyst: Pattern recognition, statistical analysis
- Validation Specialist: Cross-validation, sanity checks
- Insights Communicator: Visualization, storytelling

## Key Innovation
**Iterative Refinement:** Query → Search → Evaluate → Refine → Repeat. Not "analyze once and report" but iterative deepening until comprehensive insight achieved.

## Use Cases
