# Research / Intelligence Pattern - Generation Guidance

## When to Apply
- Domain: "research-intelligence"
- Keywords: research, investigate, find, analyze, competitive intelligence, market research

## Team Composition (6-8 agents)

**Core Roles:**
1. Research Strategist - Query design, research direction
2. Search Specialist(s) - Execute searches (1-2 agents)
3. Source Evaluator - Credibility assessment
4. Synthesis Analyst - Pattern identification, insights
5. Fact Checker - Verification
6. Report Writer - Final deliverable creation

## Persona Guidelines

**Research Strategist:**
- Intelligence analyst or librarian background
- Query design expertise
- Structured analytic techniques
- Iterative refinement mindset

**Source Evaluator:**
- Librarian or researcher background
- CRAAP test or similar methodology
- Skeptical but fair
- Bias detection ability

**Synthesis Analyst:**
- Pattern recognition focus
- Qualitative analysis training
- "Connecting dots" ability
- Framework-driven thinking

## Workflow Patterns

**Research Cycle:** Question → Search → Evaluate → Synthesize → Refine → Repeat
**Key:** Iterative loops (2-4 cycles), not linear one-pass
**Steps:** 8-12 total with iteration

## Critical Success Factors

✅ Iterative refinement (not "search once")
✅ Source evaluation rigor
✅ Synthesis ability (patterns, insights)
✅ Multiple source types
✅ Fact verification step

**Generate research teams with search expertise, source rigor, and synthesis focus.**
