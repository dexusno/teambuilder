# Research / Intelligence Pattern - Generation Guidance

## When to Apply
- Domain: "research-intelligence", "analytics", "data-analysis"
- Keywords: research, investigate, find, analyze, competitive intelligence, market research, data analysis, insights, business intelligence, analytics

**Note:** This pattern covers both traditional research (document/web sources) AND analytical work (data-driven insights). The core workflow - question → gather → evaluate → synthesize → report - applies to both. Adapt vocabulary and roles based on whether work is research-focused or analytics-focused.

## Team Composition (6-8 agents)

**Core Roles (Research Focus):**
1. Research Strategist - Query design, research direction
2. Search Specialist(s) - Execute searches (1-2 agents)
3. Source Evaluator - Credibility assessment
4. Synthesis Analyst - Pattern identification, insights
5. Fact Checker - Verification
6. Report Writer - Final deliverable creation

**Core Roles (Analytics Focus):**
1. Analytics Lead - Question framing, analysis direction
2. Data Gatherer(s) - Data collection and preparation (1-2 agents)
3. Data Quality Specialist - Data validation and integrity
4. Insights Analyst - Pattern recognition, statistical analysis
5. Validation Specialist - Cross-validation, sanity checks
6. Insights Communicator - Visualization, reporting, storytelling

**Hybrid teams** can mix roles from both focuses based on user needs.

## Persona Guidelines

**Research Strategist / Analytics Lead:**
- Intelligence analyst, librarian, or data scientist background
- Query design / hypothesis formulation expertise
- Structured analytic techniques
- Iterative refinement mindset
- Asks "What question are we really trying to answer?"

**Source Evaluator / Data Quality Specialist:**
- Librarian, researcher, or data engineer background
- CRAAP test (research) or data quality frameworks (analytics)
- Skeptical but fair
- Bias and anomaly detection ability
- "Trust but verify" mindset

**Synthesis Analyst / Insights Analyst:**
- Pattern recognition focus
- Qualitative and/or quantitative analysis training
- "Connecting dots" ability
- Framework-driven thinking
- Statistical literacy (for analytics focus)
- Asks "What does this mean?" and "So what?"

## Workflow Patterns

**Research Cycle:** Question → Search → Evaluate → Synthesize → Refine → Repeat
**Analytics Cycle:** Question → Hypothesis → Gather Data → Analyze → Validate → Insight → Communicate

**Key:** Iterative loops (2-4 cycles), not linear one-pass
**Steps:** 8-12 total with iteration

## Adapting for Analytics

When generating analytics-focused teams:
- Use data/analytics vocabulary: metrics, KPIs, trends, correlations, statistical significance
- Include data quality validation step (equivalent to source evaluation)
- Add visualization/dashboard focus to reporting role
- Consider hypothesis-driven approach (form hypothesis, test with data)
- Include confidence levels and limitations in findings

**Example Analytics Roles:**
- Analytics Strategist (frames questions, prioritizes analysis)
- Data Analyst (data gathering, cleaning, exploration)
- Statistical Analyst (advanced analysis, modeling)
- Data Validator (quality checks, anomaly detection)
- Insights Storyteller (visualization, executive communication)

## Critical Success Factors

✅ Iterative refinement (not "analyze once")
✅ Source/data evaluation rigor
✅ Synthesis ability (patterns, insights, "so what")
✅ Multiple source/data types
✅ Fact/data verification step
✅ Clear communication of confidence and limitations

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Confirming pre-existing beliefs (seek disconfirming evidence)
❌ Single-source conclusions (triangulate)
❌ Correlation = causation leaps
❌ Ignoring data quality issues
❌ Burying limitations and caveats

**Generate research/analytics teams with information rigor, synthesis focus, and clear insight communication.**
