## Market Research Workflow

```
Step 1: Research Question Decomposition
  Agent: Research Strategist
  Action: Break complex question into searchable sub-questions. Define scope and success criteria.

Step 2: Initial Search Strategy
  Agents: Research Strategist + Search Specialist

Step 6: Query Refinement (Iterative)
  Agent: Research Strategist
  Action: Based on gaps, refine search queries. New angles to explore?

Step 7: Additional Searches (Loop 2-6 until comprehensive)

Step 8: Fact Verification
  Agent: Fact Checker
  Action: Verify key claims across multiple sources. Flag unverifiable claims.

Step 9: Final Synthesis

  Action: Format findings as executive summary, detailed report, and source bibliography.

**Key:** Iterative loops, source evaluation, synthesis not just collection.
